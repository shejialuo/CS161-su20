# CS161-su20

This is my code for studying [CS161-su20](https://su20.cs161.org/).

This course has three projects, due to the unaccessible stuffs, I have done
the different semesters' projects.

+ For project 1, I study summer 20.
+ For project 2, I study from the fall 22 [website](https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/).

---

At this time, I have already studied CS161, well, I do not have enough time, so for
project 2, I just implement `InitUser` and `GetUser` function. I do not recommend
project 2 based on the following reasons:

+ When the DataStore is insecure, we just can handle things in memory, So what if
the client is shutdown?
+ If we can handle things in memory, it would be such boring!

However, thanks the team for CS161. I have learned a lot.
